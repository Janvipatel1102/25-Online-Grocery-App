# 25-Online-Grocery-App
#### Group-25  SE 
## Outline  :
#### This is a project for the design of a mobile application for grocery shopping. There are two applications - the user application and the admin application. The users can browse items from multiple stores, compare prices, buy their choice and get it delivered right to their doorstep. Stores that supply grocery items like fresh vegetables, fruits, cooked and uncooked food among others can register as merchants on the admin application. The objective will be to offer fast, convenient and reliable services to customers who would save on time they spend at the store, walking between shelves and money they pay for transport. The list of stores that the customers can buy from will be limited by the distance as the delivery time for groceries will be a constraint.
